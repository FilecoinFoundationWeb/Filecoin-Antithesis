# Introduction
Antithesis is a third-party vendor with an environment capable of performing network fuzzing. We can upload images containing docker-compose.yml files, which represent various Filecoin node setups, to the Antithesis Docker registry. Antithesis runs docker-compose up from these images to spin up a network of different Filecoin nodes in their environment and execute a test suite. Network fuzzing is performed on the network while the test suite runs, and a report is generated by Antithesis identifying bugs.
