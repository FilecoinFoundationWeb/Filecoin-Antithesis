-   **workload/**: The main driver of the application, responsible for generating activity chains and asserting test properties. Includes:
    -   **main.go**: Entrypoint of the application, a Go binary with CLI flags for different operations.
    -   **main/**: Contains driver scripts and tests categorized by naming conventions (e.g., `parallel`, `anytime`, `eventually`). These are [Test Composer](https://antithesis.com/docs/test_templates/) commands that enable Antithesis to generate thousands of test cases that will run over a multitude of system states. Test Composer handles varying things like parallelism, test length, and command order.
        -   Examples: `parallel_driver_spammer.py`, `anytime_node_height_progression.sh`, `eventually_all_node_sync_status_check.py`.
    -   **resources/**: Helper files for workloads, such as `rpc.py`, `wallets.py`, and smart contract files (`SimpleCoin.sol`).
    -   **removed/**: Contains deprecated or removed tests for reference.
    -   **go-test-scripts/**: Contains more Go tests. They are called from an executable in main. Allows for Test Composer to control these scripts.
